This project contains a demo source code showing how to build a custom pagination component in a [React][react] application. Prior experience working with the React framework is required for complete understanding of the demo code. You can checkout the [docs][react-docs] to learn more about React.

Before you begin, make sure you have [`npm`][npm] and [`node`][node] installed on your system. It is recommended that you use [`yarn`][yarn] instead of `npm` to run and manage the package. Follow this [guide to install yarn][yarn-install] on your system.

Once you have either `yarn` or `npm` installed, run the following commands to get started.

> Note that this demo was bootstrapped using the `create-react-app` package. You can look through this [extensive guide for the available scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#available-scripts).

**Using NPM**

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
